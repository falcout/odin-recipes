        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped ham and cheese sandwich that is pan or deep fried.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 and 3/4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>8 slices white bread</li>
            <li>4 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices turkey</li>
            <li>4 slices ham</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 5 inches of oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). While oil is heating, make the batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg and water. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper; whisk into the egg mixture until smooth. Set aside in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Assemble sandwiches by placing one slice of turkey on one slice of bread, a slice of ham on another, then sandwich them with the Swiss cheese in the middle. Cut sandwiches into quarters, and secure with toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Dip each sandwich quarter in the batter so that all sides are coated. Deep fry in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides. Remove toothpicks and arrange on a serving tray. Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.</li>
        </ol>
